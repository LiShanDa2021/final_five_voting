Demonstrating Final Five Voting

## Background and Purpose:

Final Five Voting is a form of Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) also known as Instant Runoff Voting (IRV). In the general election, instead of voting for just one candidate, voters rank five candidates in order of preference. Though Final Five Voting (FFV) ballots are easy enough for the average voter to fill out, the tabulation process is unfamiliar to many people.

The purpose of this web app is to help proponents of the system become proficient at counting FFV ballots so they can better educate the public on how the system works, and thus the public can make an informed decision on whether or not to adopt Final Five Voting.
